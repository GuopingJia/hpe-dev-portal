description: "March 20, 2024: On every lab test, your AI was superhuman. But how
  will it fare in the real world of smog, smears, and nation state hackers?
  We'll be demonstrating the irony of how AI hackers can measure the fragility
  of today's AI models. This will explain the AI model's vulnerability under
  real-world conditions across applications of varying data dimensions, from
  signals to images to videos. But this isn't just a zero-day warning; we'll
  show how to engineer robustness into models and sketch out tomorrow's AI
  supply chain where confidence is measurable and the model's perception can be
  inspected."
