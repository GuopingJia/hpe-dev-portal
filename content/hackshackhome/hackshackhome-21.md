description: "October 18, 2023: In our next Munch & Learn, Chase Christensen and
  Amber Graner from the HPE Ezmeral team get real about why machine learning is
  a big deal today. They break down what machine learning actually means and how
  thought leadership fits into this tech scene. They’ll explore all the perks of
  open-source machine learning and even name-drop some tools and libraries that
  are shaking things up in the field. Join us to hear them share some success
  stories showing how big thinkers can spark more use and development of these
  forward-thinking principles. To wrap things up, they’ll throw out a challenge
  to everyone listening, encouraging you to get involved and help shape the
  future of open-source machine learning!"
