## ChapelCon '24 - The Chapel Event of the Year

June 5-7, 2024

ChapelCon â€™24 welcomes anyone with computing challenges that demand performance, particularly through parallelism and scalability. Our open-source community includes those interested in parallel programming, programming languages, and high-performance computing. Building on 10 years of experience from CHIUW (Chapel Implementers and Users Workshop), ChapelCon '24 brings together Chapel users, enthusiasts, researchers, and developers to exchange ideas, present their work, and forge new collaborations.
