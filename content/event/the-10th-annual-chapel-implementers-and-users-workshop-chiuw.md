## CHIUW 2023

### The 10th Annual Chapel Implementers and Users Workshop

J﻿une 01-02, 2023

CHIUW 2023 is the 10th annual Chapel Implementers and Users Workshop, which serves as a forum where users and developers of the general-purpose Chapel programming language (chapel-lang.org) can meet to report on work being done with Chapel, exchange ideas, and forge new collaborations. Anyone interested in parallel programming and/or Chapel is encouraged to attend CHIUW, from long-term enthusiasts to those simply curious to learn more. This year's CHIUW will be online and there will be no registration fees.
