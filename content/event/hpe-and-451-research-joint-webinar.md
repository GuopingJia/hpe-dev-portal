## Hybrid Cloud by Design : Optimizing Enterprise IT for Modern Workloads

Hybrid cloud estates spanning on-premises private and off-premises public environments have become the default operating model for enterprise IT. The various capacity, cost, performance, security, governance and data locality requirements of enterprise workloads mean that IT infrastructure environments are not a “one size fits all” proposition. Agility, flexibility and operational scale and flexibility are key benefits of hybrid cloud, but increased IT complexity is the challenge when the public and private environments operate as infrastructure silos instead of systems that deliver a unified cloud operating experience. Join Latha Vishnubhotla, Chief Platform Officer at HPE, and Melanie Posey, Research Director, 451 Research, for insights on how IT leaders formulate their hybrid cloud strategies.
