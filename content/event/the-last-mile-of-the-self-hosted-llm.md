## The last mile of the self-hosted LLM

November 7, 2023

Join us on 7 November with TitanML as we bring together the HPE data science user group to discuss the latest trends, best approaches and practical experiences.

Weâ€™ll have technical talks, live demos and plenty of opportunity to network with your community while enjoying drinks, food and making the most of the table tennis at Bounce Farringdon.
