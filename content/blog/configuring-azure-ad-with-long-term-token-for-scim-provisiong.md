Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is Microsoft's cloud-based identity and access management service, designed to simplify user authentication and authorization across various applications and platforms. It offers a centralized solution for managing user identities, enforcing security policies, and facilitating seamless access to cloud-based resources. Azure AD automatic user provisioning simplifies the creation, maintenance, and removal of user identities in SaaS applications based on business rules.

The Azure AD provisioning service provisions users to GreenLake portal by connecting to user management API endpoints provided by GreenLake IAM. These user management API endpoints allow Microsoft Entra ID to programmatically create, update, and remove users and groups.
