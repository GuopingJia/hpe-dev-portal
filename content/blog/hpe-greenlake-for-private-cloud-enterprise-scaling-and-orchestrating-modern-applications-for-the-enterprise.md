In my blog post on [HPE GreenLake for Private Cloud Enterprise: Deploying and scaling traditional applications](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/hpe-greenlake-for-private-cloud-enterprise-glpce-deploying-and-scaling-traditional-applications/), I highlighted how HPE GreenLake for Private Cloud Enterprise seamlessly integrates traditional applications with modern demands, transforming infrastructure into programmable code for optimal flexibility and security. Its strategic approach to scalability ensures businesses consistently operate at their best, making applications resilient to ever-changing requirements. In this post, I'll delve into the features and capabilities of HPE GreenLake for Private Cloud Enterprise, with a specific focus on its support for scaling containers using Kubernetes (K8s). Let's explore the advancements and offerings of the HPE GreenLake for Private Cloud Enterprise platform.

**Introduction**

In today’s rapidly evolving digital landscape, it's imperative for enterprises to have agile and secure solutions that can effortlessly adapt to emerging trends. HPE GreenLake for Private Cloud Enterprise for Containers ("containers service") offers a robust solution tailored to meet these specific demands. Containers service efficiently adjusts resources based on changing workloads, ensuring optimal use. This flexibility eliminates unexpected costs, allowing businesses to pay only for the resources they use. A unified dashboard makes this process even more transparent and manageable. 

HPE GreenLake for Private Cloud Enterprise enables seamless integration between on-premises infrastructure and cloud platforms. This capability ensures that, as workloads move or scale between these environments, the performance remains consistent, providing a dependable experience for users. It's not just about meeting current needs; it's about anticipating the future. By aligning with the latest standards and supporting innovative architectural trends, HPE GreenLake for Private Cloud Enterprise positions businesses at the cutting edge of technology. In essence, containers service is a harmonious blend of traditional and modern needs, paving a clear path for businesses to move confidently into the future with unmatched agility and security.

**Kubernetes (K8s) on HPE GreenLake Private Cloud Enterprise**
HPE GreenLake for Private Cloud Enterprise provides Kubernetes deployment via its container services. Notably, it's a CNCF-compliant K8s distribution, ensuring adherence to industry standards.

**Key Points:**

1. On-premises Kubernetes: It is designed for on-premises deployments with the ability to scale based on business needs.
2. Ready to use: The platform is pre-configured, reducing setup time.
3. Performance and security: It provides consistent performance and security for operations.
4. Quick Kubernetes start: The platform features one-click provisioning that gets Kubernetes operations running fast.
5. Central Kubernetes management: Its management console allows for easy control over Kubernetes clusters.
6. Pay-as-you-go pricing: It uses a flexible pricing model where businesses pay for what they use.

Containers service stands out by delivering the security, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness modern businesses seek, maximizing resource use. In tandem with Kubernetes, containers service provides a smooth and managed infrastructure. Enhanced by HPE Ezmeral Runtime Enterprise, it gives businesses a refined platform for deploying applications, ensuring scalability, and streamlined operations.

**Under the hood – A fungible infrastructure resource pool**
As discussed in [Part 1](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/hpe-greenlake-for-private-cloud-enterprise--Exploring-a-flexible-infrastructure-resource-pool/) of this blog series, HPE GreenLake for Private Cloud Enterprise integrates an adaptable infrastructure that leverages the strengths of its infrastructure resource pool and detailed capacity planning. This approach not only addresses present business requirements but also anticipates future needs. Within HPE GreenLake for Private Cloud Enterprise, the resource pool offers flexibility, letting businesses choose container deployments on bare metal, virtual machines, or a combination of both, based on their specific demands. 
Diving into the heart of HPE GreenLake for Private Cloud Enterprise: Containers , we encounter two primary deployment models for Kubernetes: on virtual machines and on bare metal.
Kubernetes on bare metal:
•	Tailored for expansive, consistent deployments where performance is paramount.
•	Efficiency takes center stage, devoid of VM-associated costs.
•	Simplified management structure cuts down on overhead
•	Perfect for business-critical applications or those where speed and responsiveness are crucial, like financial or imaging apps.

Kubernetes on virtual machines offers:
•	Delivers optimal performance in diverse environments, making it an ideal choice for development
•	Offers flexibility in deployments with the convenience of having mixed workloads run simultaneously
•	Typical applications include general-purpose web apps and event-driven microservices

In essence, whether your workload requires the adaptable environment of VMs or the robust power of bare metal, containers service ensures your Kubernetes deployments are optimized to your unique needs.

**K8s in Action on HPE GreenLake for Private Cloud Enterprise**
In the evolving landscape of enterprise IT, scalability isn't just a luxury; it's a necessity. With HPE GreenLake for Private Cloud Enterprise and Kubernetes at its helm, businesses are equipped to meet dynamic demands head-on. When administrators first work with HPE GreenLake, they can manually allocate resources based on anticipated needs. But as traffic unpredictably rises, Kubernetes springs into action, enabling it to scale. 
Kubernetes, with its sophisticated orchestration capabilities, monitors workloads in real-time on HPE GreenLake for Private Cloud Enterprise. Should traffic surge unexpectedly, Kubernetes autonomously scales containers, ensuring optimal performance without overburdening resources. 
The combined prowess of manual fine-tuning with Kubernetes' automated scalability represents the future-forward approach of HPE GreenLake for Private Cloud Enterprise, promising enterprises reliability, efficiency, and adaptability all in one package.
