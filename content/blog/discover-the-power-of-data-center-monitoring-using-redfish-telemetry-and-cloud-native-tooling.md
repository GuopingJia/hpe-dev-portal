Monitoring data center infrastructure is critical for ensuring optimal performance, resource utilization, and timely issue detection. Redfish, an open industry standard for hardware management, provides a standardized way to access telemetry data from servers and other devices. Coupling Redfish telemetry with cloud-native monitoring tools offers a robust solution for real-time monitoring, data analysis, visualization, and alerting. 

## Why does data center monitoring matter?

Data centers are the backbone of modern businesses, housing critical applications, databases, and services. Ensuring the seamless operation of these data centers is essential for business continuity and meeting the demands of today's digital world. Data center monitoring helps with following:

* **Performance Optimization:** Monitoring helps identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and potential failures, allowing for proactive optimization.
* **Resource Utilization:** Tracking resource usage ensures that capacity is allocated effectively, saving costs and energy.
* **Predictive Maintenance:** Real-time insights enable predictive maintenance, reducing downtime and associated costs.
* **Compliance:** Monitoring helps meet regulatory requirements by maintaining accurate records and ensuring security.

## A comprehensive approach

Our latest technical whitepaper, *“[Data center monitoring using Redfish telemetry and cloud-native tooling](https://www.hpe.com/psnow/doc/a00134351enw)”*, presents a comprehensive approach to data center monitoring by integrating the Redfish telemetry with cloud-native open-source tools including Telegraf, Prometheus, Alertmanager, and Grafana. These tools work seamlessly together to provide a holistic view of your data center infrastructure. The telemetry data source for this stack is HPE Integrated Lights-Out (iLO) which exposes metrics via Redfish interface.

Here's a glimpse of what you'll discover in the whitepaper:

* **Understanding Redfish Telemetry:** Learn about the Redfish standard and how it simplifies hardware telemetry data collection.
* **Cloud-Native Tools:** Explore the capabilities of Telegraf, Prometheus, and Grafana and how they enhance data center monitoring.
* **Architecture:** Dive into the architecture of this integrated solution, detailing how data flows from the source to the visualization layer.
  Setup Process: Follow a step-by-step guide on how to set up this monitoring solution in your data center.
* **Benefits:** Understand the benefits of this approach, including real-time monitoring, scaling, and customizable visualization.

## Take the Next Step
