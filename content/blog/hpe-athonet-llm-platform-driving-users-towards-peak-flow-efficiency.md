* ["The transformative impact of generative AI on Telco products"](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/the-transformative-impact-of-generative-ai-on-telco-products/)
* ["HPE Athonet LLM Platform: From personal assistant to collaborative corporate tool"](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/hpe-athonet-llm-platform-first-pillar-from-personal-assistant-to-collaborative-corporate-tool/)

It has been detailed how HPE Athonet is constructing a solution anchored in three fundamental aspects:

* Shifting towards a framework that centers on team collaboration.
* Elevating the user experience to foster productivity and concentration on tasks.
* Crafting a flexible infrastructure grounded in data mesh methodologies, encompassing the management of security and ethical standards.

These components collectively illustrate HPE Athonet's dedication not solely to the advancement of technology but also to the promotion of true digital evolution within network management through the application of generative AI. This article further explores the second core principle shaping the strategy: the enhancement of usability and user experience to assist individuals in maintaining focus on their tasks. While current chatbot solutions offer limited functionalities, HPE Athonet's goal is to introduce a tool that significantly improves task concentration and multitasking capabilities. By creating a system that can be augmented with additional tools or plugins, the intention is to support users in sustaining focus and potentially reaching a state of "Flow," where they are at peak productivity. This strategy reflects design concepts present in some eLearning platforms, focusing on user involvement and efficiency, as outlined in the provided [“Flow, a key concept for UX designers”](https://www.ux-republic.com/en/flow-a-key-concept-for-ux-designers/).

Major companies in the tech industry are incorporating generative AI assistants across their office tool suites. HPE Athonet’s approach significantly diverges; rather than amplifying a variety of general-purpose products for individual usage, the aim is to forge a specialized instrument geared towards augmenting team collaboration specifically within 5G project realms. This instrument consolidates all vital data and resources, facilitating each team member’s effective engagement and seamless contribution to unified project endeavors.


HPE Athonet introduces a novel feature allowing the selection of a particular project, which unlocks a comprehensive archive of all related actions and a set of project-specific tools. For instance, when evolving a new attribute for the HPE Athonet 5G core, the project archive might encompass customer feature inquiries, viability studies, and strategic evaluations by product managers and architects, in addition to relevant 3GPP standards details. This amalgamation ensures seamless access to all essential data for the R&D team via a straightforward chat interaction with the tool as they commence development.


The platform accommodates individual and collective discussions, maintaining the project archive up-to-date with fresh insights. To further refine the user experience, it is vital not only to address user queries but also to exhibit the source content, potentially showcasing the pertinent document segment with highlighted key areas. Furnishing an answer's relevance score could further enhance user engagement.


For tools interfacing with devices or 5G networks to present real-time insights, the integration of sophisticated visualization attributes like Key Performance Indicator (KPI) charts, geographical mappings, and system layouts is vital. These improvements should transcend mere textual exchanges, providing a user interface that skillfully renders data through the most effective multimedia elements. This strategy guarantees that information is not just reachable but also intuitively understandable, empowering users to immediately digest complex data and make prompt, well-informed choices.


Technical instruments often demand specific input formats; thus, HPE Athonet is also introducing the ability to customize the user interface integration within the chatbot. All these initiatives aim in a unified direction: to assist the user in efficiently accessing or performing required tasks through a straightforward interface that can link to multiple tools.
