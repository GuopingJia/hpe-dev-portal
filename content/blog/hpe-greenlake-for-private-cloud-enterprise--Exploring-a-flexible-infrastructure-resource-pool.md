## Allocation / Deallocation 

HPE GreenLake for Private Cloud Enterprise (GLPCE) supports resource allocation in line with expected workloads. Should a cluster harbor idle resources, they can be redirected to areas of higher demand. It offers consumption analytics and ongoing monitoring tools to ensure efficient resource utilization. I'll delve deeper into this concept with a forthcoming visual representation.

![Screenshot 1: Initial allocation ](/img/blog1.png "Screenshot 1: Initial allocation ")

> > <span style="color:grey; font-family:Arial; font-size:1em">Screenshot 1: Initial allocation </span>

## Resource allocation strategy

**Initial allocation**: As seen in screenshot 1, the initial resource allocation process is primarily based on anticipated workload demands. When preparing for extensive data-processing tasks, customers can allocate a higher number of memory-optimized (M2i) instance types to Cluster 2 within the virtualization resource pool. On the other hand, for every day, routine operations, Cluster 1 is typically outfitted with general purpose (G2i) instance types to ensure smooth and efficient operations. This allocation strategy aims to match resource types with the specific requirements of each cluster. 

![Screenshot 2: Reallocation ](/img/blog2.png "Screenshot 2: Reallocation ")

> > <span style="color:grey; font-family:Arial; font-size:1em">Screenshot 2: Reallocation </span>

**Reallocation**: As illustrated in screenshot 2, there are times when instances within the bare metal resource pool remain unused. These idle resources are not merely dormant; they hold value. As shown in screenshot 2, these instance types can be quickly reallocated to any virtualization clusters based on their current needs. Such dynamic reallocation ensures optimal resource utilization, adapting promptly to varying workload demands.

## Tune resource allocations 

**Monitoring for efficiency/capacity**: Using HPE GreenLake for Private Cloud Enterprise, you can continuously monitor the utilization rates across all three services: bare metal, virtual machines, and containers. To understand how such resource utilization is tracked and assessed, check out the next section on Capacity planning and monitoring.

> > <span style="color:grey; font-family:Arial; font-size:1em">*Screenshot 3: Responsive adjustments*  </span>

**Responsive adjustments**: Referring to screenshot 3, observe that if Cluster 2 possesses idle memory optimized (M2i) instances, they can be shifted from Cluster 2 either to the bare metal pool or to Cluster 1, depending on demand. Conversely, if Cluster 1 has surplus general purpose (G2i) units, they can be relocated in a similar manner. Such adaptability ensures that resource utilization is consistently maximized, preventing them from sitting unused when they could be beneficial elsewhere.
