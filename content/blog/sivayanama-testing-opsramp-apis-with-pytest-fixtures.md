# Sivayanama - Testing OpsRamp APIs with PyTest Fixtures

<!--EndFragment-->



OpsRamp platform  provides rich set of APIs. By using these APIs customers can build soultion to automate various ITOM workflows such as discovery and monitoring , event and incident mangement and remidiation and automation. Testing these APIs, automated solution  are very critical to ensure reliability and stability of the same. PyTest is a powerful python testing framework and it is widely used to test APIs. Fixtures is one of the most important capabilities of PyTest framework. In this article, we will discuss some advanced techniques of testing OpsRamp APIs using PyTest fixtures.



What Fixtures are 

PyTest fixtures are a special type of python function that provision fixed base line for testing.With the help of this base line we can ensure tests are run in reliable manner and produce consistent results and the same tests can be repeatable.



Install PyTest

Run the below command 

pip install -U pytest

 

Verify PyTest installation 

Run the below command 

 pytest --version

pytest 7.4.0



Define Fixture

We can define fixtures just by decorating a simple python function with [@pytest.fixture](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/reference.html#pytest.fixture) for example 



import pytest



@pytest.fixture

def hello_world()

return 'Hello, Happy testing'



Invoking fixtures

Test functions can invoke fixtures just by declaring the required fixtures as arguments. 



def test_hello_world(hello_world)

assert hello_world == 'Hello, Happy testing'
