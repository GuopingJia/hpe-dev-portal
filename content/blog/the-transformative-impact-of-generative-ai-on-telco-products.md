In February 2024, Harvard Business Review published an insightful article titled “[Turn Generative AI from an Existential Threat into a Competitive Advantage](https://hbr.org/2024/01/turn-generative-ai-from-an-existential-threat-into-a-competitive-advantage)”. The article outlines three strategic approaches for integrating generative AI into business operations to secure a competitive edge:

1. **Adopting public AI tools:** Utilizing readily available AI technologies, like ChatGPT, offers early movers a competitive edge by enhancing efficiency and innovation. Early adoption offers a competitive edge, though the advantage may be short-lived as such tools become universally essential. 
2. **Customizing AI tools:** Tailoring AI tools with company-specific data improves customer experiences through personalized services and interfaces. This strategy, fueled by user feedback, advances towards more sophisticated AI applications, enhancing both customization and usability.
3. **Automating data feedback loops**: Implementing self-improving AI through automatic feedback loops from customer interactions boosts personalization and efficiency. Despite the challenge of integrating these mechanisms smoothly, it offers a sustainable competitive advantage.

At HPE Athonet, our goal is to achieve this third level of implementation to enhance internal efficiency and maximize the value we deliver to our customers. This enables them to leverage our private networks for groundbreaking innovations. To achieve this, we are developing a generative AI platform founded on three core principles:

1. **Transition from individual tools to a team-centric collaborative framework:** Shifting the focus towards collaborative efforts that enhance team synergy and productivity.
2. **Designing a user experience to enhance focus and facilitate flow:** Crafting an interface that minimizes distractions and supports users in achieving a state of deep concentration, or 'Flow'.
3. **Building a versatile architecture incorporating data mesh and microservices principles:** Developing a flexible system architecture that integrates advanced data management and service-oriented designs to support scalable and efficient operations.

We showcased a proof of concept (PoC) of our innovative solution at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, February 2024. Our chatbot demonstrated its capability to fetch information and execute commands over Athonet's 5G networks effectively.

The PoC highlighted the ability of our reasoning engine to orchestrate multiple tools, enabling seamless connection to Athonet 5G networks via APIs and efficient retrieval of document information, both features accessible through chat interactions.

This pioneering approach not only showcases the potential and flexibility of this architecture in network systems management but also emphasizes the profound impact such technologies can have on the digital transformation journey. We designed this strategy with the aim to elevate HPE Athonet into a future where AI not only enhances but significantly boosts our operational capabilities and the value we deliver to our customers.

Stay tuned for our upcoming posts where we will delve deeper into the core components and principles of this idea.
