HPE Technology and Solution Summit 2023 (HPE TSS 2023) goes physical again this year in sunny Barcelona. After being relegated to virtual sessions these last couple of times, you will once again enjoy the pleasure of being able to engage with an HPE Developer Community representative in person. This time, all our sessions will be held by our new team member, Mathieu Losmede.

HPE TSS is the largest HPE technical event that is held in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) geography. Whether you are an HPE Presales or Partner, you will have the opportunity to attend technical breakout, Hands-on Labs, as well as strategic keynotes, and also finally get to meet your peers in person!

T﻿he decision to hold this event at a physical location came late this year. As a result, the HPE Developer Community team will be unable to bring the complete, well-loved Hack Shack to the event. And we will only be able to spare one member of our team to attend and run our sessions. However, we will be offering a number of sessions, hands-on labs, and a few surprises. 

**Meet our new team member: Mathieu Losmede**

M﻿athieu joined the HPE Developer Community team last summer. He was present at Discover 2022 with us at Las Vegas in the Hack Shack. You can see him between Patrick and myself on the following picture. He will be the face of the HPE Developer Community team in Barcelona.

Mathieu came in with a strong HPE GreenLake background. He was part of the HPE GreenLake Cloud Service (aka Greenlake Central) SRE - Devops team. As our team's focus has recently shifted more heavily towards the HPE GreenLake Cloud Platform, we were very fortunate to have him join our group. 

Mathieu will be all over the place in Barcelona. One might wonder whether he managed to discover the secret of ubiquity. He will be delivering several technical breakouts either on his own or in partnership with other business units (BU) representatives (HPE GreenLake, Storage, Compute, and Aruba). He will also be co-presenting in other BUs' sessions. On top of these, he will deliver three hands-on labs based on our well-known [Workshops-on-Demand](https://developer.hpe.com/hackshack/workshops) project.

**Techies just wanna have fun!**

As always,the HPE Developer Community team brings in new ways to learn in a fun way. This year at TSS 2023 in Barcelona, we propose you to participate to a treasure hunt. Do not worry, no long walking needed there, we won't be sending you looking for clues in the city of Barcelona. All you will be needing is an internet browser and a few minutes. The treasure hunt will be available from the HPE TSS mobile app. It will start on Monday the 22nd of May at 12.00 pm CEST and end on Thursday the 25th of May at 10.00 CEST.  

Three winners will be selected. The winners will receive their prizes on Thursday, May 25th on the show floor at the HPE GreenLake booth at 12:15pm CEST.
