## Whatâ€™s New?


Recently, a new set of REST APIs for GreenLake Edge to Cloud Platform was introduced on the [HPE GreenLake Developer website](https://developer.greenlake.hpe.com/docs/greenlake/services/data-services/public/) at https://developer.greenlake.hpe.com/docs/greenlake/services/data-services/public/.  These APIs are grouped under the set which is called HPE GreenLake API for Data Services.
