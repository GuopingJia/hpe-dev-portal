This blog post describes the process to expose an application that's deployed and runs on Kubernetes in HPE GreenLake for Private Cloud Enterprise to the external world. 
A Nginx app that serves as a Web server that prints out a customized application name will be used as a sample app to expose. The application itself will be deployed as 
the service type of ClusterIP, runnin on HTTP. Using cert-manager and TLS termination on configured MetalLB load balancer, the application will be exposed over HTTPS. 



### Overview

* A K8s cluster, being provisioned in HPE GreenLake for Private Cloud Enterprise
