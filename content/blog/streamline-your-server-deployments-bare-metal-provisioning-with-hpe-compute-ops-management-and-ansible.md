In the rapidly-evolving world of IT infrastructure management, achieving speed, efficiency, and reliability in server provisioning can make a significant difference. This is where cutting-edge tools like [HPE GreenLake for Compute Ops Management](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/hpe-greenlake-compute-ops-management.html) and [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) come into play. Together, they create a robust platform for managing your infrastructure seamlessly. In this blog post, we introduce an exciting new GitHub project that exemplifies how to harness these tools for optimal bare metal provisioning.

## Introducing a new GitHub project
I am excited to share a new project, an open-source initiative hosted on GitHub that aims to enhance the integration between HPE GreenLake for Compute Ops Management and Ansible. This endeavor is focused on making it easier to configure, manage and provision bare metal servers at scale.


## Key highlights of this project 

- **Automated Provisions**: Kickstart your server setups without the tedious manual configurations.
- **Centralized Control**: Manage your entire fleet of servers from a single pane of glass.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Effortlessly scale your infrastructure to meet growing business demands.
- **Pre-Built Playbooks**: Jumpstart your automation with curated collection, crafted for various deployment scenarios (Microsoft Windows Server, VMware ESXi and Red Hat Enterprise Linux).
- **Custom Ansible Variables**: Enable you to define environment-specific parameters, ensuring that each server gets a configuration that fits its role in the infrastructure, ensuring that you have granular control over server provisioning.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed guides, videos and examples help you customize the workflow to your specific requirements.


## Mastering Server Management with HPE GreenLake for Compute Ops Management

HPE GreenLake for Compute Ops Management is a comprehensive solution for hardware resource management, providing a seamless way to handle server deployments. With its ability to manage health monitoring, orchestrate server configuration and firmware update workflows, and automate bare metal provisioning, administrators can ensure their data centers operate optimally with less effort and greater oversight. To learn more, see [HPE GreenLake for Compute Ops Management](https://www.hpe.com/emea_europe/en/hpe-greenlake-compute-ops-management.html)

## Bridging HPE GreenLake for Compute Ops Management and Ansible

HPE GreenLake for Compute Ops Management provides the foundational management capabilities essential for maintaining data center health and efficiency. When combined with the automation capabilities of Ansible, IT administrators can achieve unprecedented levels of automation.

## Bringing it all together
- **Automated Workflows**: Convert time-consuming manual processes into automated workflows that can be tracked and managed easily.
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Embrace growth without compromising on performance or manageability.
- **Reduced Human Error**: Minimize mistakes by standardizing server configurations across the board.

## Mastering parallel execution with Ansible

A key attribute of Ansible that I sought in this project is its impressive capability to execute tasks concurrently across numerous systems, thereby accelerating deployment processes. This feature is referred to as "forks" within Ansible. Set at a default of 5, the forks value is adjustable based on available system resources (CPU and memory), signifying that Ansible can carry out playbook tasks in parallel across five hosts from the inventory list. This parallel execution is among Ansible's standout functionalities, enhancing the effectiveness of bare-metal provisioning substantially. Moreover, this approach ensures consistent configurations across all provisioned hosts.

## Explore My Video Series

Dive into my video series showcasing the seamless bare metal operation across three major operating systems. Each video provides a walk through over the different variables involved and the files that are required to update HPE drivers and software, along with the explanation of the different steps of each playbook.
